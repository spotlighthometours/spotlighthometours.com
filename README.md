RETS MD
=======

This repository maintains the source code used for retsmd.com.  Use the code in your own, local copy or contribute your improvements back and they'll be synced to retsmd.com on a regular basis.

The initial code isn't meant to win any awards.  As with nearly all projects, this started off solving a particular need and has evolved to include many more pieces than originally visioned.

Fork it and contribute your changes back!
